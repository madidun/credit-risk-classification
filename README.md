# credit-risk-classification
Project Description: In this project, I started by splitting the data into training and testing data. Then I created a logistic regression model with the original data and fit the model using the same data. I will evaluate the model's performance using the confusion matrix, the accuracy model and the classification report. 
An overview of the analysis: The analysis to clearly show the results of the project and how it is used. 
The results: I would reccommend this model. 
Accuracy Score- This shows how accurate the predictions are.
Precision Score- This will show just how accurate the predictions are and how close it is to being exact.
Recall Score- This shows just how the predictions are correct.
A summary: I think using this model is really helpful because you get to see how accurate the predictions are and you use simple methods. I reccommen using this model because it was very quick and delivered accurate ad clear results.
